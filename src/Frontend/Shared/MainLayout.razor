                        I have an app where I need to make millions of requests as fast as possible each request using a different proxy and agent. Reading about HttpClient, its intended use is to create one instance for multiple requests, but I don’t see where/how a different proxy can be used for each request. Are there examples available on how to do this?
                        <MudChip Size="Size.Small" Label="true" Color="Color.Info">Can be improved</MudChip>
                        Or is there a better way to do this that’s thread safe?

                        Thank you.
